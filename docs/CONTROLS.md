## How to Play

### Basic Gameplay Loop

4. **Manipulate Supply**: When not possessing, click on houses to curse or bless them
5. **Earn Chaos Points**: Cause economic chaos through bad trades and supply manipulation
6. **Release**: Press ESC to release the kid and observe the chaos you've caused

### Tips

- Energy regens when not possessing - let it recharge!
- Curse houses to create shortages (lowers house quality)
- Bless houses to create surpluses (raises house quality, attracts kids)
- Bad trades give you chaos points - the worse the trade for your kid, the better for your score
- Watch your energy bar - possession drains energy over time
